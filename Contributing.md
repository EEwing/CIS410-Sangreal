To contribute to this project, there are 2 steps: Cloning the repository, and Loading the repository into Unity.

## 1. Cloning the Repository:
This step is standard. Open your command prompt/terminal and navigate to your workspace folder. 
From there, type "git checkout https://github.com/EEwing/CIS410Platformer.git".
You should now have the project, and are ready to load it into Unity.

This same process is availabe through the Github GUI, but you don't have as much control over what you do with the repo,
so I suggest to just get comfortable with the Command Line Interface for Git.

## 2. Loading into Unity:
This is an easy step, but could possible fail if I didn't set up the repository correctly.
Simply put, Open unity, click the "Open" button at the top right, and navigate to $WORKSPACE/CIS410Platformer. Then click "Select Folder".
It will give you a warning about different Unity versions, and mention that it has to rebuild a Library for you, that is fine.
The Library isn't included in the github repo because it is extrapolated from the source, and is rebuilt every time you modify the source.
Now, once you have loaded it up, try to run the game in Unity, and it should work!
